## Lab 1: Food Ordering Program
This program simulates a food ordering experience. The user is presented with four daily specials, and after selecting one, they are given three unique food options to choose from for that special. The final choice is printed back to the user.

## Lab 2: Name Input and Vowel Counter
The program prompts the user for their name, analyzes the input letter by letter, counts vowels, and loops until an empty string is entered. The vowel count is reset for each new name.

## Assignment 1: BMI Calculator
A multi-part assignment that takes user input (name, height in feet and inches, weight), calculates their BMI in kilograms/mÂ² using height in meters and weight in kilograms, and displays the result.

## Lab 3: Science Fiction Censorship
The program takes a user-provided sentence and censors a list of predefined "science fiction curse words" by replacing them with "BEEP". The censored sentence is then displayed.

## Assignment 2: Word Jumble and Caesar Cipher
This assignment has two parts:
1. A Word Jumble game where the user guesses jumbled words.
2. An Encrypt/Decrypt feature using Caesar Cipher, where the user provides a shift value and text, and the program both encrypts and decrypts the message.

## Lab 4: Factor Frequency Chart
The program generates random numbers and creates a frequency chart that shows which numbers between 2 and 53 evenly divide each random number.

[Lab 4 Source Code](./lab04.py/)

---

## Assignment 3: Event Calendar
An event calendar where the user inputs a date and an event, and the program stores it in a dictionary. The program ensures valid input and displays all dates with events when requested.

## Lab 5: CSV File Loader and Subreddit Analyzer
The program prompts the user for a CSV file, loads it, and then displays subreddit data from the file. The user is repeatedly asked for valid input until the program can load the file correctly.

## Lab 6: Dice Rolling Simulation
This program simulates rolling dice. The user decides how many dice to roll and the number of sides per die. The program displays the results of each roll and the sum of all rolls, repeating until the user decides to stop.
